Try running it without installing anything let me know if it works.

To run EcoSim you have to call it from the command line 
so do "./EcoSim input.txt"

within input.txt are the parameters of the simulation
look in there for more detail

within the program you will see:
a grid where things move 
a log of all the actions that are happening
start button - this starts the program
pause button - to pause the program (to resume, press start)
save button  - this saves the log to "Events.log"
